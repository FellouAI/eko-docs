## What is Eko?
Eko (pronounced like ‘echo’) is a production-ready agent development framework designed to help developers build reliable agents by supporting natural language and programming languages. It provides a unified interface for executing agents in the digital world, including both computer and browser environments, with the following key features:
- **Hybrid design language**: Developers can write agents by both natural language and programming languages, enabling production-grade agent design.
- **Unified digital World interaction**: Eko offers a unified syntax that is applicable across various digital environments, including computers and browsers, for seamless agent development.
- **Transparent and intervenable agents**: During agent execution, users can inspect its state in real-time and modify its behavior, ensuring greater control and security.
