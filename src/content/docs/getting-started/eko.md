## What is Eko?

Eko is an agent development framework designed to help developers build reliable agents by supporting natural language and programming languages. It provides a unified interface for executing agents in the digital world, including both computer and browser environments, with the following key features:

- **Hybrid design language**: Developers can write agents by both natural language and programming languages, enabling production-grade agent design.

- **Unified digital World interaction**: Eko offers a unified syntax that is applicable across various digital environments, including computers and browsers, for seamless agent development.

- **Transparent and intervenable agents**: During agent execution, users can inspect its state in real-time and modify its behavior, ensuring greater control and security.

## Eko philosophy

Eko (like "echo") transforms natural language into action - your words become executable workflows. As JavaScript developers, we built Eko because we believe web technologies are the ideal foundation for human-AI interaction, with their universal reach and rich UI capabilities.

### Core Principles

1. **Natural + Logical**: Blend natural language with JavaScript/TypeScript, giving you the best of both worlds - the expressiveness of natural language and the power of modern web tech

2. **Stability Through Structure**: Our [Two-Layer Execution Model](/docs/architecture/execution-model) provides predictable automation while remaining flexible enough to handle real-world complexity

3. **Web-Native Design**: Built on the JavaScript ecosystem you already know, with seamless integration for browsers, Node.js, and modern frontend frameworks

4. **Developer Experience First**: Debug and modify workflows with familiar tools - no black boxes

### Mission & Vision

We believe the next evolution of programming will blend natural language with code. Eko aims to make this future accessible to the JavaScript community first, leveraging the ecosystem's strengths in UI, tooling, and cross-platform development.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Programming**: Convert natural language task descriptions into executable workflows, making agent development more intuitive
- **Two-Layer Execution Model**: Separate offline planning from online execution, making agent decisions more structured and explainable
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Rich built-in tools for browser automation, computer control, file operations, and web interactions
- **Hybrid Drive System:** Combine LLM capabilities with developer control, enabling "human in the loop" and allowing interference at multiple levels of granularity
- **Event-Driven Automation:** Trigger workflows based on browser or system events
- **Environment Flexibility**: Work across different environments ( [Browser Extension](/docs/browseruse/browser-extension), [Web](/docs/browseruse/browser-web), [Node.js](/docs/computeruse/computer-node), [Next-Gen AI Browser Fellou](/docs/computeruse/computer-fellou) ) with consistent APIs
