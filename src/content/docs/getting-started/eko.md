## What is Eko?
Eko is an agent development framework designed to help developers build reliable agents by supporting natural language and programming languages. It provides a unified interface for executing agents in the digital world, including both computer and browser environments, with the following key features:
- **Hybrid design language**: Developers can write agents by both natural language and programming languages, enabling production-grade agent design.
- **Unified digital World interaction**: Eko offers a unified syntax that is applicable across various digital environments, including computers and browsers, for seamless agent development.
- **Transparent and intervenable agents**: During agent execution, users can inspect its state in real-time and modify its behavior, ensuring greater control and security.

## Mission & Vision
We believe that the next evolution of programming will seamlessly integrate natural language with code. Eko's mission is to bring this future to life for the JavaScript community first, harnessing the ecosystem’s strengths in UI, tooling, and cross-platform development.

## Eko philosophy
Eko (pronounced like 'echo') transforms natural language into action—turning your words into executable workflows. As JavaScript developers, we created Eko because we believe web technologies provide the perfect foundation for human-AI interaction, thanks to their universal accessibility and rich UI capabilities.

## Core Principles
- **Natural + Logical**: Combine natural language with JavaScript/TypeScript to offer the best of both worlds—expressive language and the power of modern web technologies.
- **Stability Through Structure**: Our Two-Layer Execution Model delivers predictable automation while remaining flexible enough to tackle real-world complexity.
- **Web-Native Design**: Built on the JavaScript ecosystem you already know, offering seamless integration with browsers, Node.js, and modern frontend frameworks.
- **Developer Experience First**: Debug and modify workflows using familiar tools—no black boxes, just full transparency.

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Programming**: Convert natural language task descriptions into executable workflows, making agent development more intuitive
- **Two-Layer Execution Model**: Separate offline planning from online execution, making agent decisions more structured and explainable
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Rich built-in tools for browser automation, computer control, file operations, and web interactions
- **Hybrid Drive System:** Combine LLM capabilities with developer control, enabling "human in the loop" and allowing interference at multiple levels of granularity
- **Event-Driven Automation:** Trigger workflows based on browser or system events
- **Environment Flexibility**: Work across different environments ( [Browser Extension](/docs/browseruse/browser-extension), [Web](/docs/browseruse/browser-web), [Node.js](/docs/computeruse/computer-node), [Next-Gen AI Browser Fellou](/docs/computeruse/computer-fellou) ) with consistent APIs
