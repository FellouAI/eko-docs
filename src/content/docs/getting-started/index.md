# Getting Started with Eko

## What is Eko?

Eko is an agent development framework that enables programmatic control of browsers and operating systems through a combination of natural language and traditional programming interfaces. At its core, Eko provides:

1. A workflow system for orchestrating complex sequences of actions
2. A tool abstraction layer that unifies access to browser/OS capabilities
3. Integration with Large Language Models for task planning and execution
4. Programming interface for agent behavior inspection and control

The framework is particularly focused on bridging the gap between natural language task descriptions and concrete system actions through a structured approach.


## Key Features

- **Natural Language Programming**: Convert natural language task descriptions into executable workflows, making agent development more intuitive
- **Two-Layer Execution Model**: Separate offline planning from online execution, making agent decisions more structured and explainable
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Rich built-in tools for browser automation, computer control, file operations, and web interactions
- **Hybrid Drive System**: Combine LLM capabilities with developer control, allowing interference at multiple levels of granularity
- **General Framework**: Work across different environments (Node.js, browser extensions) and support different LLM backends
