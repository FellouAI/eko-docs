# Eko docs

## What is Eko?

Eko is an agent development framework that enables programmatic control of browsers and operating systems through a combination of natural language and traditional programming interfaces. At its core, Eko provides:

1. A workflow system for orchestrating complex sequences of actions
2. A tool abstraction layer that unifies access to browser/OS capabilities
3. Integration with Large Language Models for task planning and execution
4. Programming interface for agent behavior inspection and control

The framework is particularly focused on bridging the gap between natural language task descriptions and concrete system actions through a structured approach.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Eko docs project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ content/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ docs/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ env.d.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
